  # things to do:
  # ruby gems that allow to switch between ruby versions that i install
    # rbenv - ruby environment
      # older - almost legacy
      # mostly in environments that they haven't updated their ruby gems
      # created all the libraries for rvm in this
      # less functionality than rvm and chruby
    # rvm - ruby virtual machine
      # rvm.io
      # command for switching - rvm ruby <version>
    # chruby - change ruby
      # sometimes doesn't work on mac, only sometimes
      # gem install chruby
      # command for switching - chruby <version>

  # install newest version of ruby so i can work in the newest environment
  # chruby is easier to use, but may give me problems - start there.

  # need chruby or rvm before installing rspec
    # rspec
      # 1st 2 or 3 modules are review
