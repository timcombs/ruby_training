# how to fix my CG_training directory? when i push origin master from the chris_pine_tut directory it deletes the other directories. it looks like i've either duplicated CG_training inside chris_pine_tut or there's some recursion? in any case, i had moved directories inside this, created new directories and then tried to make CG_training the master branch directory for git to push from to github when I had accidentally made the chris_pine_tut directory earlier. did i accidentally make two masters branch directories? we will need to sit down and look at the directories to figure out what is going on.

# public vs private methods - how to make a private method public?

# all three types of heredocs work the same when i run the simple code.
# is this just a style issue then?

# i would like to understand how you pass through the logic of this code
# don't need to know what it all does, just how the boolean works
# inflections.plurals.each do |(rule, replacement)|
#   break if result.gsub!(rule, replacement)
# end

# array2 = [0, -10, -9, 5, 9]
# array3 = array2
# # CAREFUL!!! when changing array2 this also mutates array3
# # so how to do this?!!? do i somehow use CONSTANTS?!!?
# p array2
# array2.each_index { |i| array2.delete_at(i) if array2[i] < 0 }
# p array2
# p array3
# array3.delete_if { |x| x < 0 }
# p array3
# puts ''
# would pass as argument into a class which makes it not mutable
# or stick it in a database or sometimes a yaml file

# A* matches zero or more A's - does this mean any single character AND any single character followed by an infinite numbers of A's?

# don't understand this syntax #<MatchData "Force">

# are there regex groups that aren't capture groups?

# is to_a used only on MatchData objects?
